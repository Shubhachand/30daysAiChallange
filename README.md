Welcome to my journey through the **30 Days of AI Voice Agents** challenge! üöÄ  
This repo tracks my progress from **Day 1 to Day 30**, building AI-powered voice apps using **FastAPI**, **AssemblyAI**, and other tools. Each day, we build something new ‚Äì from simple TTS to real-time transcription bots.

## üî• What We Built So Far

### ‚úÖ Day 1 ‚Äì Project Setup & UI Bootstrapping
- Initialized FastAPI backend
- Created clean responsive UI using HTML & CSS
- Setup file structure: `static/`, `templates/`, `main.py`

---

### ‚úÖ Day 2 ‚Äì Text-to-Speech with Murf.ai
- Connected Murf API to backend
- Built `/generate` endpoint
- User enters text ‚Üí Audio is generated
- Audio is playable from the UI

---

### ‚úÖ Day 3 ‚Äì Echo Bot Recording UI
- Added recording functionality using `MediaRecorder` API
- Start/Stop buttons to control audio recording
- Saved audio locally in memory (no server upload yet)

---

### ‚úÖ Day 4 ‚Äì Audio Waveform Visualizer
- Used `Canvas` to show live audio waveform
- Integrated `AnalyserNode` from Web Audio API
- Made UI futuristic with pulse animations üéß

---

### ‚úÖ Day 5 ‚Äì Upload Audio to Server
- Built `/upload-audio` POST endpoint
- Saved uploaded audio file in `/uploads` directory
- Returned file name, type, and size from server
- Displayed upload status in frontend

---

### ‚úÖ Day 6 ‚Äì Transcribe Audio via AssemblyAI
- Used AssemblyAI Python SDK
- Created `/transcribe/file` endpoint that:
  - Accepts audio file
  - Transcribes using `transcribe(audio_data)`
  - Returns full transcript
- Displayed transcription on frontend after recording

---
### ‚úÖ  Day 7 ‚Äì Echo Bot v2 üé§‚ú®

- Record audio in the browser
- Upload to backend via /tts/echo endpoint
 - Transcribe audio using AssemblyAI
 - Generate AI voice from transcription using Murf API
 - Play back the AI-generated voice in the browser
 - It‚Äôs like talking to yourself‚Ä¶ but in a perfect studio voice üéôÔ∏è
