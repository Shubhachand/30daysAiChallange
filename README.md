Welcome to my journey through the **30 Days of AI Voice Agents** challenge! 🚀  
This repo tracks my progress from **Day 1 to Day 30**, building AI-powered voice apps using **FastAPI**, **AssemblyAI**, and other tools. Each day, we build something new – from simple TTS to real-time transcription bots.

## 🔥 What We Built So Far

### ✅ Day 1 – Project Setup & UI Bootstrapping
- Initialized FastAPI backend
- Created clean responsive UI using HTML & CSS
- Setup file structure: `static/`, `templates/`, `main.py`

---

### ✅ Day 2 – Text-to-Speech with Murf.ai
- Connected Murf API to backend
- Built `/generate` endpoint
- User enters text → Audio is generated
- Audio is playable from the UI

---

### ✅ Day 3 – Echo Bot Recording UI
- Added recording functionality using `MediaRecorder` API
- Start/Stop buttons to control audio recording
- Saved audio locally in memory (no server upload yet)

---

### ✅ Day 4 – Audio Waveform Visualizer
- Used `Canvas` to show live audio waveform
- Integrated `AnalyserNode` from Web Audio API
- Made UI futuristic with pulse animations 🎧

---

### ✅ Day 5 – Upload Audio to Server
- Built `/upload-audio` POST endpoint
- Saved uploaded audio file in `/uploads` directory
- Returned file name, type, and size from server
- Displayed upload status in frontend

---

### ✅ Day 6 – Transcribe Audio via AssemblyAI
- Used AssemblyAI Python SDK
- Created `/transcribe/file` endpoint that:
  - Accepts audio file
  - Transcribes using `transcribe(audio_data)`
  - Returns full transcript
- Displayed transcription on frontend after recording

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (vanilla)
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
- **APIs**: Murf.ai (TTS), AssemblyAI (Transcription)
- **Audio**: MediaRecorder API, Web Audio API, Canvas
- **Dev Tools**: VS Code, Postman, Git

---

## 🚀 Final Goal (Day 30)

- 🎯 Build a **complete AI Voice Agent app**
- 🧠 Features: TTS + Echo + Transcription + Real-time streaming
- 🌐 Deploy app on Render / Vercel / Railway
- 📸 Post final demo on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubhachand/)
